  summary: "Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone"
  description: |
    nano  is  a small and friendly editor.  It copies the look and feel of Pico, but is free software, and
    implements several features that Pico lacks, such as: opening multiple files, scrolling per line,
    undo/redo,  syntax coloring, line numbering, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.
